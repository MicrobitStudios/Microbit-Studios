Our Whitepaper will be launched here on May 17th 2019.  
Our Token sale will launch on June 3rd 2019 on Waves Platform.  
Our company website will launch in June following our Token Sale.  

### Short 
Our token will be listed on Waves DEX as "MiBiToken" and will cost between 0.003 and 0.006 WAVES on launch (about 0.01 USD), depending on WAVES trajectory.
After the ICO is finished we will replace the "MiBiToken" with our official company Cryptocurrency, more information about this will be posted on our official channels and website during that time.

The Microbit Studios' cryptocurrency will be backed with real company shares at 10:9 ratio. Meaning that for every 10 coins a person holds, that person will be entitled to 9 company shares. These shares will be backed by the company's cryptocurrency exclusively and will, for the foreseeable future, not be listed on stock exchanges.  
Registered coin holders will be granted a total of 35% of company profits each booking quarter, in one of four ways; BTC, WAVES, Microbit Studios' coin, USD (wiretransfer only).

For detailed information please refer to our whitepaper.
